## About
This is my personal blog which uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Toha](https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha). It is built and published via [Github Actions](https://github.com/sepffuzzball/blog.sepffuzzball.com/actions/workflows/publish.yaml) to [ghcr.io](https://github.com/sepffuzzball/blog.sepffuzzball.com/pkgs/container/weblog).

Behind the scenes, my infrastructure uses [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/) to pull and keep the actual [public site](https://blog.sepffuzzball.com/) up to date.
