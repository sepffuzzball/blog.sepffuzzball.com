# Equipment

Listing of the equipment Sepfy typically uses

## Cloak of Displacement
Varying shades of black and gray with silver runic stitching on the outer lining (like in the cape below). Easily through behind his back to give his arms and legs a lot of mobility so even the shawl over (in the second pic) splits open from the front. Does not have the displacer beast appendages

## Spark, Lightning Blade
Thin bladed one-handed sword with intricate designs. (ignore the colors on the second picture, it’s not actually meant to be pink). Scabbard held on the left-hand side for a right-handed draw (the scabbard below is just generic and wouldn’t make sense to taper back inwards at the top…the blade bulge probably shouldn’t be so prominent anyways). Lightning imbued with enchanted gemstones, it’s visibly and audibly quite flashy (technically a poor choice for a rogue so used when combat is inevitable). Only ever wielded in the right hand

## Solidarity, Cursed Blade
Slightly shorter than the Lightning blade, also kept on the left-hand side for a quick left-handed reverse-grip draw for the hidden blade in the hilt (it’s a spring-loaded blade, there’s not actually a cutout in the main blade). It’s blade is straight and not curved with no real guard and it’s scabbard is almost parallel to the ground and slightly crossed with the lightning blade’s scabbard making an X. Almost always used in the left-hand in a dual-wield scenario. It’s their outlet for demonic/necrotic powers and only ever enchanted with those types of energies (so blackish/purplish energy)

## Heward’s Handy Haversack
Main backpack when traveling as it only ever weighs 5 lbs. Their blade of warning is strapped underneath, parallel to the ground (it can change which side it’s drawn from - for stealth it’s set for a right-hand reverse draw but for combat it’s usually placed on the left side).

## Blade of Warning
Somewhat similar in look to Solidarity in that it’s a guardless, straight-bladed sword but it’s quite a bit shorter (more close to a tanto or shorter wakizashi). Typically strapped underneath his haversack, this blade vibrates when danger is near (ignore hilt color in this case as well). If Sepfy doesn’t have his haversack he’ll typically still have this strapped on his battle harness in a similar/same position

## Thieves Tools in Leather Case
Without the prominent saw and hammer and a bit more finesse tools like in the second pic but I do like the book-style case of the first.

## Enchanted Flash Darts/Knives and Holster
They’re most often used as throwing knives/darts. Sometimes they’re actually hidden underneath his forearm and not on his leg (so opposite of a bracer) - they do sometimes just appear out of nowhere. When they hit their target they make a bright, blinding flash and can be used similar to a smoke bomb to get away or as a distraction
{{< img src="/posts/references/character-sheet/equipment/blenderdarts.png" align="center" title="Flash Darts" >}}

## Enchanted Leather Armor
Consists of a hard leather chest piece with matching bracers, kneepads, and shinguards. The leather is died black and has intricate, nearly floral silver inlays that can glow as a source of dim light and the metal is all polished silver. The main chest piece is two halves with 2 leather clasps on each of the sides as well as between the shoulders and neck with additional attachment points for his main battle harness (straps for scabbards and the like). There is a socket on the chest piece that has an inlaid gem that he uses as a focus. He doesn’t wear anything under the chest piece, thus their midsection is always exposed.

## Sapphire of the War Mage
A 1-inch diameter sapphire etched with eldritch runes on the socketed portion and outer edges. Glows when Sepf casts a spell so it is typically underneath their cloak if there is a need to be sneaky. Runes not pictured below but would not be in the main center portion
{{< img src="/posts/references/character-sheet/equipment/sapphireblender.png" align="center" title="Sapphire" >}}

## Battle Harness
Reconfigurable leather straps and buckles that allows Sepf to move where their weapons are - Sepfy does (theoretically) change equipment often. Sometimes there’s another strap that goes between the two main belts for added stability or other straps are added elsewhere on their body. Almost always has at least two straps across their chest and waist for their main weapons but they can sometimes appear quite random. Usually a darker brown (black and browns, how scandalous!)

{{< img src="/posts/references/character-sheet/equipment/battleharnessstraps2.png" align="center" title="Battle Harness" >}}

## Skirt
Sepf swears by the skirts - honest, it’s not them trying to be skimpy! It’s all about mobility first of course! It’s usually more gray, black and white instead of the pink as below (just don’t have time to redo the texture). It tends to look a bit more fantasy than schoolgirl but it is fairly short. Of course so they can move quickly and dexterously! Can add more straps if it looks cool

## Geta of Silent Strides
(AKA Boots of Elvenkind) Even though they look noisy, they’re enchanted to help be silent! The wood could be a bit darker than in the pics and probably makes sense to have a strap over the back ankle for when he needs to run

{{< img src="/posts/references/character-sheet/equipment/getablender2.png" align="center" title="Geta" >}}

## Black Leatherbound Spellbook inlaid with silver
Should also be metal accents on the corners and held closed with two straps (top and bottom) - just simple straps with clasps

{{< img src="/posts/references/character-sheet/equipment/spellbook2.png" align="center" title="Spellbook" >}}
{{< img src="/posts/references/character-sheet/equipment/spellbook3.png" align="center" title="Spellbook" >}}

## Decanter of Endless Water, Leather Wrapped
Sort of the cross between the two images below. Not quite as decanter-y as the top one but with the metal accents and fancy stopper, but wrapped in leather and the bottom being more of a water bottle in the second image.

{{< img src="/posts/references/character-sheet/equipment/decanter2.jpg" align="center" title="Decanter" >}}

## Vial Kit with Rare Inks and Ebony Dip Pen
Instead of the eye dropper would have a spot for the pen and each vial would have a different shimmering color

## Component Pouch and Heward’s Handy Spice Pouch
These pair of spice pouches would be easily confused at a glance, but one is for spices and the other for spell components. They can be placed on Sepfy’s battle harness straps but they’re not typically done so as many of their spells they can cast will either use a focus or no material components at all (and rarely do they need salt so readily available either)! A little bit more formed than a standard drawstring pouch but the design is absolutely up in the air
{{< img src="/posts/references/character-sheet/equipment/pouch.png" align="center" title="Pouch" >}}

## Ebony Handled Silver Chopsticks, Knife, Spoon, and Leather Case
Should all be part of a matching set with all having ebony handles and fine polished silver
