# Sepfy

**Level 15** Chaotic Neutral Arcane Trickster/Bladesinger (Rogue/Wizard)
Vulpine (Tradewind)/Canine (Wolf) (Any Pronouns)

## Ability Scores
| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |

## Personality
Confident, inquisitive, and beguiling, Sepfy can be found just as often in a noble’s keep, a seedy tavern, or a dark alleyway. Tactically aggressive in battle they tend to take an active role, mixing magic and precise bladed assaults with their multitude of enchanted weapons and spells. Prefers the bigger cities but is constantly having to travel to different ones in order to reduce their likelihood of being captured or worse. Enjoys food, learning magic, treasure hunting and procurement of rare antiquities. Flirtatious when there is something to be gained from it and tends to act quite chipper and engaging despite their dark past, even if that’s only a facade.

## Summary Bio

Sepf Rei Ennui had a harrowing childhood and had to quickly learn to adapt in order to survive, although the story would certainly change whenever anyone were to ask them. They weren’t purposefully abandoned as a child but nevertheless ended up on the streets and learning how to fend for themselves. They were smaller and weaker than everyone but quickly learned the ways of the pickpockets, thieves, and rogues. Over the course of their childhood they were the sole survivor in 3 harrowing events that shaped them into the constant traveler that they are today.

● Under the guise of being taught magic, the young rogue narrowly survived a vampiric religious cult with the help of a wandering swordsman at the expense of their best friend’s life  
● Inducted as an assassin-in-training due to their prowess with magic and their rogue capabilities they were the sole survivor of their graduation class and ended with a bounty on their head due to an internal coup ● While on the run they joined with a mercenary band and ended up getting possessed by a demon in a dungeon and ended up killing the majority of their mercenary troupe before defeating the demon using the cursed blade Solidarity.  

Now cursed by a demon they wander from city to city as their past constantly tries to catch up to them and the voices of a demon haunts them.
