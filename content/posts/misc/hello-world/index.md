# Hello World

Hi I'm Sepfy! It's been a long time coming but I decided to finally get off my rear and get a new blog site up. Expect lots of geeky, nerdy, techy things here involving hardware, software, and other such things that tickle my fancy!

I imagine the vast majority of it’s usage will be for art references for the multitude of stuff that I commission! And if not…well I’m sorry, not sure why you’d want to be here! In either case, please enjoy your stay!
